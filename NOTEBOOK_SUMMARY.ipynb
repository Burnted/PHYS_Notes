    "### Validation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Far-field limit**: At large distances, should match point charge behavior\n",
    "   - All charge appears concentrated at origin\n",
    "   - Force should follow Coulomb's law: $F = k q Q / r^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Symmetry checks**:\n",
    "   - Force on equatorial plane (z=0) should be radially symmetric\n",
    "   - No z-component force should exist by symmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analytical solution on z-axis**:\n",
    "   - For test charge on cylinder axis, can solve analytically\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Magnetic Dipole Moment**: How to characterize a magnet\n",
    "   - Dipole moment $\\vec{m}$ (in A⋅m²)\n",
    "   - Can be measured experimentally\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Magnetic Field from Dipole**:\n",
    "   - Along axis: $B_z \\approx \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{2m}{z^3}$ (near field)\n",
    "   - General formula involves complex vector calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Forces on Magnetic Objects**:\n",
    "   - Force ∝ gradient of field: $\\vec{F} \\propto \\nabla(\\vec{m} \\cdot \\vec{B})$\n",
    "   - Real magnets can't be approximated as simple dipoles at very close range\n",
    "   - Experimental measurement becomes necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Since analytical solutions for real magnets are intractable:\n",
    "1. **Measure force experimentally** using precise balance\n",
    "2. **Fit model parameters** to experimental data\n",
    "3. **Use fitted model** for force predictions in regime of interest\n",

    "### Important Concept: When to Use Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the pragmatic approach to physics:\n",
    "- **If analytical solution exists**: derive and use it\n",
    "- **If numerical integration works**: implement it (like Notebook 04)\n",
    "- **If neither feasible**: measure experimentally, then fit models\n",
