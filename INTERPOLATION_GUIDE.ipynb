    "Interpolation is the process of estimating values between known data points. You might need interpolation in two common scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Interpolation**: You have discrete data points and need to evaluate values between them\n",
    "2. **Function Approximation**: Evaluating a function is computationally expensive (e.g., numerical integration), so you compute it at discrete points, then use interpolation to approximate it elsewhere\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario\n",
    "If calculating an electric or magnetic field takes several minutes per point, you can:\n",
    "- Calculate the field at a grid of points\n",
    "- Use interpolation to quickly estimate the field at other locations\n",
    "- Save the interpolated function to file for later use\n",
